# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Find the strategy for Aeroplane Chess game.

## Hypothesis:
For the players, stacking the planes can increase the chance to win the game
Controlling the number of planes on the track no more than 1 will be more likely to win the game

## Analytical Summary of your findings: 
When the player chooses to stack the planes or controlling the number of planes on the track, the wins ratio will increase compared to the situation that the player does not choose any strategies. 
Controlling the maximum number of planes on the track as 1 is the best strategy.

## Instructions on how to use the program:
Please run the 'aeroplane_chess.py'.
